                 eXBonez GUI Profile Manager
                        CHANGELOG
============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0 — Initial Release
------------------------------------------------------------
• First public release of the GUI Profile Manager.


------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1 — Feature Updates & Improvements
------------------------------------------------------------
• Added ability to register devices with exclusive extensions
  so profiles can be read correctly when using hardware from
  different manufacturers.

• Added support for recording up to 10 mouse clicks for
  software that requires navigating through multiple menus.

• Improved wait times and menu‑read prompts for mouse‑click
  automation.

• Added “Open Profile Folder” button to all tabs for faster
  navigation.


------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2 — Enhancements, Fixes & Quality‑of‑Life Updates
------------------------------------------------------------
• Fixed sorting options.  
  – Profiles tab now sorts alphabetically (folder‑based
    limitation).  
  – All other tabs sort properly using the selected method.

• Added ability to delete previously added device hardware.

• Game Editor tab now includes an option to automatically
  close the application after launching a game.

• Game Launcher now supports per‑game delay timers before the
  GUI closes.  
  – The GUI always closes after launching a game (by design).  
  – Delay allows extra time for hardware profiles to finish
    loading if needed.  
  – Future option to minimize instead of close may be added.

• General bug fixes and stability improvements.
